# Monster Management

## Objective

Develop a program to manage a team of monsters using static arrays. Use a 2D array to store monster attributes and a 1D array to store monster names. Implement functionality to display the highest and lowest values for each attribute. Use loops to perform these operations efficiently.

## Requirements

### Data Storage

The program should use:
- A 1D array to store monster names
- A 2D array to store corresponding attributes:
  - Speed
  - Attack Power
  - HP Level
  - Defense

### Functionalities

The program should implement the following functionalities:
- Display the highest and lowest values for each attribute along with the monster names.
- Display all monster names with their corresponding attributes.

### Display

The program should display:
- The highest and lowest values for each attribute with monster names.
- A list of all monsters with their corresponding attributes.

## Steps

### 1. Set Up Project

- Create a new C++ project and set up your development environment.
- Include necessary headers (`<iostream>`, `<string>`).

### 2. Define Variables

- Define a 1D array to store monster names.
- Define a 2D array to store monster attributes (Speed, Attack Power, HP Level, Defense).

### 3. Initialize Arrays

- Initialize the arrays to store a fixed number of monsters (e.g., 5 monsters).

### 4. Find Highest and Lowest Attribute Values

- Use loops to find the highest and lowest values for each attribute and the corresponding monster names.

### 5. Display Results

- Display the highest values and lowest values for each attribute, and all monster names with their corresponding attributes.
